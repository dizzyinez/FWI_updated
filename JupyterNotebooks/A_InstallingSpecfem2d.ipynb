    "### INSTALLATION\n",
    "First, make sure that gfortran is installed on your computer. If your operative system is iOS, you will probably need to install XCODE. Look for the version of gfortran compatible with the installed version of XCODE. If you don't have XCODE installed, download it from the App Store and install the Command Line Tools (CLT). If the error \"Fortran compiler cannot create executables\" is prompted during the compilation of SPECFEM2D, uninstall and re-install CLT. Instructions for this can be found in the following video: https://youtu.be/8n_AfrQjgp4  \n",
